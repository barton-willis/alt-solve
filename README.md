# alt-solve
Alternative solve function for the Maxima CAS

This code aims to be a replacement for Maxima's solve function. The goal is to maintain compatibility with Maxima's current solve function,  make the code easier to extend and to fix, and to solve a wider variety of equations than the current solve function.
